 <h1>My very first website</h1>
  <p>My journey with tech4girls began about a month ago with 
    so much uncertainties, but with the support and motivation 
    of our incredible moderators and teachers, i now have a sense of direction. <br>
    The program started with 1 week of induction, 3 weeks of soft skill training
     (problem solving skills,enterpreneurship skills, critical thinking and 
     social media marketing) <br>
     and we have had 2 weeks of coding lessons so far. The more we progress the tougher it gets
     however, i am not going to give up but rather keep practising what i am been taught. </p><br>
      <h2>How it's going</h2>
    <p>Some of the activities I have learnt so far is how to create a figma account,wireframe of
         a website and convert the wireframe into a mock up file. <br>
     i have been able to learn how to create folders in vs code and it is work in progress</p><br>
     My favourite part of this program is how the instructors are very welcoming. 
     I have ben able to also make lot of friends, some of them are able to assist me when i have 
     learning difficulties. 
     I love my <u>frontend development class</u> <br>
     i love my  <i>instructors</i><br>
     I love  <b>Tech4Girls</b> <br>
     I love  <b>HACSA</b>

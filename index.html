 <h1>From curosity to coding</h1>
  <p>Meet Lawrencia, a young woman who recently decided to embark on a new and 
    exciting journey into the world of <b>technology</b>and coding. She had always been curious about how websites and applications <br>
    worked, but never imagined she would start learning how to build them herself. <br>
    <h2>The First Steps</h2>
     Lawrencia began by learning the basics of Html, the foundation of web development. She created her first web page, adding headings, paragraphs, and even formatting her text using <B>bold</B>, <i>italic</i>, and <u>underline</u> <br>
     elements
    Every new tag she learned a sense of accomplishment. <br>
    She quickly became comfortable with HTML elements and is eager to explore more. <br>
    Next on her list: learning more HTML elements amd CSS to style her web pages! <br>
    <h3>Challenges and Growth</h3> <br>
    The journey wasn't always easy. Lawrencia encountered errors, bugs, and challenges that tested her patience. <b>But she never gave up</b>.
    She knew that with every mistake, she was one step closer to becoming a <br>
    confident coder. 
    At the end of this program, Lawrencia can build simple web pages and will slowly venture into JavaScript
      </p><br>
      <h2>How it's going</h2>
    <p>Some of the activities I have learnt so far is how to create a figma account,wireframe of
         a website and convert the wireframe into a mock up file. <br>
     i have been able to learn how to create folders in vs code and it is work in progress</p><br>
     My favourite part of this program is how the instructors are very welcoming. 
     I have ben able to also make lot of friends, some of them are able to assist me when i have 
     learning difficulties. 
     I love my <u>frontend development class</u> <br>
     i love my  <i>instructors</i><br>
     I love  <b>Tech4Girls</b> <br>
     I love  <b>HACSA</b>
